# Titanic

---

Here we demonstrate how to use logistic regression for binary classification task. We use the [titanic][1] data set. In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Install

First you should compile and install the f2m package on your own computer. You can read the [install.md][2] for the installation detail.

## File

We have three files in this demo:

 1. train.txt: Training data set
 2. test.txt: Test data set
 3. titanic.conf: Configuration for this demo

The train.txt and test.txt have been transformed into the csv format. Note that in this demo the validation set and test set are the same file. (test.txt)
